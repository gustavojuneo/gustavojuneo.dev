      "Transitioning to a full-stack capacity, I became responsible for the entire development lifecycle of new features. On the back-end, I engineered new microservices in C# and .NET, leveraging Entity Framework for data persistence and RabbitMQ for creating resilient, message-driven systems. I focused heavily on performance, optimizing database queries and refactoring slow batch processes with parallelism. To ensure system reliability, I built a comprehensive observability stack with Jaeger, Prometheus, and Grafana. I also developed real-time functionalities using WebSockets and SSE. In addition to these back-end responsibilities, I continued to lead front-end development, ensuring seamless integration and high-quality user experiences.",

      "In this role, I took ownership of key architectural and performance initiatives. I led the strategic migration of our internal component library to TypeScript and pioneered the adoption of a Micro Front-End architecture with Module Federation. On the performance side, I optimized our build system by fine-tuning the Webpack configuration and improved front-end load times by implementing skeleton screens. I also expanded our development infrastructure by building out robust CI/CD pipelines that automated quality checks and deployments. Beyond technical tasks, I actively mentored other developers and contributed to our roadmap by analyzing new features and defining technical tasks for the team.",
